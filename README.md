We have arranged all sourcecode files by folder such that the implementation matches the different phases made.

Please note that to run some of these functions (whose output is already specified in the report) you might need to
copy all input .dat files, heartrate csv files and the python files in the same folder and then execute the code,
otherwise it may not run.

We have used Matlab as well as Python 3.5 for implementation and have included all input and output files generated.

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you!
